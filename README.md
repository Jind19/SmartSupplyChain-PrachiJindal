# SmartSupplyChain

-- Building the core of SmartSupplyChain, a Java-powered logistics system that handles the flow of products — 
from suppliers, through warehouses, to customers — safely, scalably, and fault-tolerantly.

-- Each module reflect best practices in:

OOP (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance)
Generics (type safety, bounded types, wildcards)
Exception handling (custom exceptions, input validation)
Collections (List, Map)
System simulation (via main())
